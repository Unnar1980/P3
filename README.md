#Arcade game clone.

This is an independent version of the classic game Frogger.

   Chrome 4.0, Explorer 9.0 and Firefox 2.0.

2. Run the game by open index.html in web browser.

3. The player is moved with the arrow buttons.

4. Pressing other buttons than the arrow buttons 
   results in changing the player's outlook.

5. Points are gained by hitting the sea at the top
   of the screen (worth 100 points) and by obtaining
   the bonus elements which appear randomly on the
   gray grids. The bonus items which give points are 
   the gems and the key. 

6. The player has 3 lives to begin with. Lives are
   lost by running into the enemy bugs which cross
   the screen from left to right. New live can be
   gained with a collision witht the heart.

7. The player can get immune by colliding with the
   star or the selector. When the player is in the state
   of immunity it appears as a rock. When immune
   the player is immune to collision with the bugs.

   automatically reset and the maximum score of the
   player recalculated.
